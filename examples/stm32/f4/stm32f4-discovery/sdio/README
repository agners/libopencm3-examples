This example program uses the SDIO block to communicate with a SD-Memory-Card.
While fist SD-commands can be executed, it still lacks block read/write 
support. Everything is done blocking at the moment, but it will be converted
to use interrupts later.

Connect SD-DATA0-DATA3 to PC8-PC11 on the discovery board.
Connect SD-CMD to PD2 on the discovery board.
Connect SD-CLK to PC12 on the discovery board.
Also connect GND to GND and VCC to 3V.

I connected the SD-Card using cables. It might need pull-up resistors and 
a PCB to use higher speeds.

The terminal settings for some debug output are 38400 8n1. To use the terminal
Connect your TTL RX device line to PA2 on the discovery board.
Connect your TTL TX device line to PA3 on the discovery board.
